# Frozen Lake Agent in OpenAI Gym

## Overview
This project involves designing and training an agent to navigate the Frozen Lake environment in OpenAI Gym's Toy Text. The agent is trained through exploration and utilizes the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to improve decision-making. The goal is to optimize the agent's policy to reach the destination efficiently and maximize cumulative rewards.

## Features
- Designed an agent to navigate the Frozen Lake environment.
- Trained the agent through exploration using the Markov Decision Process.
- Improved decision-making by updating state values and policy based on Bellman’s Equation.
- Optimized the policy for faster goal achievement and higher cumulative rewards.

## Environment
- **Environment**: Frozen Lake from OpenAI Gym's Toy Text.
- **Goal**: Navigate the frozen lake and reach the goal while avoiding falling into holes.

## Methodology
- **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**: Used to model the agent's decision-making process, considering states, actions, rewards, and transitions.
- **Bellman’s Equation**: Applied to update state values and refine the policy for better performance.
- **Policy Optimization**: Focused on improving the agent's actions to reach the goal quickly and efficiently.

## Conclusion
The agent’s decision-making was enhanced by using exploration strategies and continuous policy updates. The optimization led to a more efficient agent capable of navigating the Frozen Lake environment with increased performance.
